# Linux Process Analyzer

`process_analyzer` is a lightweight Linux command-line tool written in C that periodically samples process information from `/proc` and provides aggregated statistics at the end of execution.

The tool is designed for **low-overhead monitoring**, accurate **time-based calculations**, and **post-run analysis** of CPU, memory (RSS), and disk I/O usage per process.

---

## Features

- Periodic process sampling with configurable interval
- Accurate CPU usage calculation using monotonic time
- Memory (RSS) tracking:
  - Average RSS
  - RSS increase since startup
  - RSS delta
- Disk I/O metrics per process:
  - Total bytes read / written
  - Average disk read/write rate (KB/s)
- Snapshot logging with log rotation
- Graceful shutdown on `CTRL+C` or `SIGTERM`
- Supports infinite runtime mode
- Minimal runtime dependencies (glibc only)

---

## Typical Use Cases

- Investigating long-running background processes
- Identifying disk-heavy applications over time
- Post-mortem analysis after performance degradation

## What this tool is NOT

- Not a real-time interactive monitor (like `top` or `htop`)
- Not a system-wide resource accounting tool
- Not intended for per-thread profiling

---

## How It Works

At each sampling interval, the tool:

- Reads process data from `/proc/[pid]/stat`, `/proc/[pid]/status`, and `/proc/[pid]/io`
- Stores a snapshot of all running processes (in text and jsonl format)
- Accumulates statistics over time using **monotonic timestamps**
- Designed to minimize per-sample overhead even at small intervals (tens of milliseconds)

At the end of execution (or when interrupted), the requested metrics are calculated and displayed on the console and in a `metrics.json` file.

---

## Time Handling

- **`CLOCK_MONOTONIC`** is used internally for all delta and rate calculations  
  (CPU usage, disk I/O rates, averages)
- **`CLOCK_REALTIME`** is used only for human-readable timestamps in logs

This guarantees stable measurements even if the system clock changes.

---

## Configuration File

The tool supports an external configuration file that controls output behavior and log rotation.

### Configuration File Location

The configuration file path is provided via an environment variable:

```bash
export PROCESS_ANALYZER_CONFIG=/path/to/configuration.config
```

If the variable is not set, default values are used.

If a configuration file is present but invalid, the program exits with an error.

---

### Example Configuration File

```ini
# Output directory (default: /tmp/ptime)
output_dir=/home/user/ptime

# Raw snapshot output
raw_log_enabled=true
raw_jsonl_enabled=true
raw_console_enabled=false

# Metrics output
metrics_on_console=true
metrics_on_json=true

# Log rotation
max_file_size=5m
max_number_of_files=3

# General options
include_self=false
```

-j, --delete_old_files      Delete old log files
-v, --version               Show version
-h, --help                  Show help
```

---

## Example

```bash
./process_analyzer \
    -i 50ms \
    -n infinity \
    -c 10 -r 10 -s 10 -d 10 \
    -e 10 -f 10 \
    -g 15 -a 15 \
    -j
```

Stop the program using `CTRL+C`.

## Snapshot Logs

Each sampling iteration is logged as a snapshot.

## Log Storage & Rotation

All output files are stored in `output_dir`.

By default:

```
/tmp/ptime/
```

Rotation settings are configurable via the config file.

---

## JSON Output

- `metrics.json` follows a versioned schema
- Schema documentation: [SCHEMA.md](SCHEMA.md)
- Snapshot data uses JSON Lines format (`.jsonl`)

---

## Performance & Benchmark

Tests were performed on:

- CPU: Intel Core i7 (8th generation, 8 cores)
- Laptop: HP ProBook 450 G5
- OS: Ubuntu Linux

### Results

| Sampling Interval | CPU Usage (process_analyzer) |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| 15 ms             | ~12% (single core saturated) |
| 30 ms             | ~7.5%                        |
| 1 s               | ~0.17–0.2%                   |

Notes:

- The analyzer is single-threaded
- At very small intervals (<20ms), one CPU core may reach near 100%
- For long-running monitoring, intervals ≥100ms are recommended

## Limitations & Notes

- Requires Linux with `/proc`
- Disk I/O depends on kernel support
- Short-lived processes may have fewer samples
- Tested on modern systemd-based distributions

### Missing RSS and I/O data

RSS and I/O values are reported as `-1` when unavailable.

Common causes:

1. Kernel threads (`kworker/*`)
2. Process exits during sampling

### Impact on aggregated metrics

Invalid samples are excluded from calculations.

Only dependent metrics are skipped.
